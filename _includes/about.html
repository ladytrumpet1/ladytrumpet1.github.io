              <h2>About G’Day <em>(the famous Australian slang for ‘Good Day’)</em> Travelers</h2>
              <br/>
                <p>G’Day Travelers is my travel blog, i am Audrey, born in France, citizen of Earth. After over 10 years travelling and  living my dream on the road, i decided to share with you my scenic travel, ideas, my experiences and lessons, and my love of meeting new people from different cultures…</p>
                <p>About me</p>
                <p>I grew up in Paris, city of love. I’ve studied my masters in music and anthropology, i started my journey in Brazil playing trumpet as a traveling musician during the Carnaval de Olinda & Recife, Pernambuco. Then, the travel bug hit me. I’ve now visited 27 countries so far. It ’s not a record, because i prefer to spend long periods in each country, minimum a month sometimes up to a year, and often come back to revisit some of my favourites. As an anthropologist, I’ve always enjoy to live and eat with the locals, find beautiful place without tourists, As a polyglot i love learning local languages but always with the cute french accent :-)</p>
                <p>Now I’m following my dream to open a digital/entrepreneur nomad career. The blog and online travellers shop is my place to share with you items that I and many travellers have found invaluable.<p/>
                <p>Everyday moment is a new beginning. It doesn’t matter what happen yesterday. All that matters in now and the  day in front of you, starting it with a fresh and happy attitude.</p>
                <p>Have a good one!</p>
